## Backup / cross-cluster data workflow

Bulk data (datasets, raw artefacts, run outputs that are too large for
git) lives on Google Drive under the layout
`gdrive:projects/<project>/<subpath>/<filename>`. Code goes to GitHub;
only files that need a durable off-cluster home go to Drive.

Three scripts implement the contract (installed by
`~/dotfiles/bootstrap.sh` into `~/.local/bin/`):

| Command          | Purpose                                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `gdrive-push`    | `rclone copy` a path to `gdrive:projects/<proj>/<sub>/`         |
| `gdrive-pull`    | inverse                                                         |
| `gdrive-archive` | tar + pigz a directory, upload, keep local by default (`--rm` to delete) |

Project name auto-resolves from `basename(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`,
overridable via `-p` or `$PROJECT_NAME`. All three accept `-n` for
dry-run. Use dry-run first for anything large or when the destination
subpath is new.

Detailed policy (when to invoke, restore flow, ignore_list.txt rules)
lives in the `backup-to-gdrive` skill. The skill is the authoritative
source — this section is just a pointer.

The same dotfiles repo (`~/dotfiles`, `git@github.com:demiranda-gabriel/dotfiles.git`)
is the single source of truth across every cluster I work on. Run
`~/dotfiles/bootstrap.sh` once per cluster after cloning.

## Per-project `DATA_MANAGEMENT.md`

Every project root contains a `DATA_MANAGEMENT.md` that classifies every
top-level file and directory into exactly one of three categories:

- **git-tracked** — committed and synced with GitHub on the working branch.
- **gdrive-tracked** — bulk data under `gdrive:projects/<project>/<subpath>/`,
  moved with the `gdrive-push` / `gdrive-pull` / `gdrive-archive` scripts.
  Not committed.
- **local-only** — ephemeral, regenerable, or environment-specific. Not
  committed, not backed up.

Rules:

1. Anything listed in `.gitignore` is either gdrive-tracked or local-only.
2. Anything not in `.gitignore` is git-tracked.
3. When a new top-level entry appears, classify it in the same commit
   that introduces it.
4. Before deleting a local copy of a gdrive-tracked path, confirm a
   recent push exists (`gdrive-push -n` first).

When entering a project that lacks `DATA_MANAGEMENT.md`, create one by
listing `ls -A` at the project root, reading `.gitignore`, and grouping
entries under the three headings above.
